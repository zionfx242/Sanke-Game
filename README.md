# Snake-Game
This is a web version of the classic mobile game: Snake.
This project was made using HTML, CSS & Javascript.

The basis of the game was creating a blue square for the snake and a yellow square for the food.
The snake moves around if it colides into itself or the edge of the screen. A popup would then display telling the player to start over again.
